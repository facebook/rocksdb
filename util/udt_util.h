// flag change.

// the immediately effective persist_user_defined_timestamps flag is false.
// 3) switch user comparator to disable user-defined timestamps feature provided

// comparator ranks user keys exactly the same as the old user comparator and
// only add / remove the user-defined timestamp comparison. We don't have ways
// to strictly enforce this so currently only the RocksDB builtin comparator
// wrapper `ComparatorWithU64TsImpl` is  supported to enable / disable
