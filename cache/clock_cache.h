// HyperClockCache is an alternative to LRUCache specifically tailored for
// use as BlockBasedTableOptions::block_cache
//
// Benefits
// --------
// * Lock/wait free (no waits or spins) for efficiency under high concurrency
//   * Fixed version (estimated_entry_charge > 0) is fully lock/wait free
//   * Automatic version (estimated_entry_charge = 0) has rare waits among
//     certain insertion or erase operations that involve the same very small
//     set of entries.
// * Optimized for hot path reads. For concurrency control, most Lookup() and
// essentially all Release() are a single atomic add operation.
// * Eviction on insertion is fully parallel.
// * Uses a generalized + aging variant of CLOCK eviction that might outperform
// LRU in some cases. (For background, see
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_replacement_algorithm)
//
// Costs
// -----
// * FixedHyperClockCache (estimated_entry_charge > 0) - Hash table is not
// resizable (for lock-free efficiency) so capacity is not dynamically
// changeable. Rely on an estimated average value (block) size for
// space+time efficiency. (See estimated_entry_charge option details.)
// EXPERIMENTAL - This limitation is fixed in AutoHyperClockCache, activated
// with estimated_entry_charge == 0.
// * Insert usually does not (but might) overwrite a previous entry associated
// with a cache key. This is OK for RocksDB uses of Cache, though it does mess
// up our REDUNDANT block cache insertion statistics.
// * Only supports keys of exactly 16 bytes, which is what RocksDB uses for
// block cache (but not row cache or table cache).
// * Cache priorities are less aggressively enforced. Unlike LRUCache, enough
// transient LOW or BOTTOM priority items can evict HIGH priority entries that
// are not referenced recently (or often) enough.
// * If pinned entries leave little or nothing eligible for eviction,
// performance can degrade substantially, because of clock eviction eating
// CPU looking for evictable entries and because Release does not
// pro-actively delete unreferenced entries when the cache is over-full.
// Specifically, this makes this implementation more susceptible to the
// following combination:
//   * num_shard_bits is high (e.g. 6)
//   * capacity small (e.g. some MBs)
//   * some large individual entries (e.g. non-partitioned filters)
// where individual entries occupy a large portion of their shard capacity.
// This should be mostly mitigated by the implementation picking a lower
// number of cache shards than LRUCache for a given capacity (when
// num_shard_bits is not overridden; see calls to GetDefaultCacheShardBits()).
// * With strict_capacity_limit=false, respecting the capacity limit is not as
// aggressive as LRUCache. The limit might be transiently exceeded by a very
// small number of entries even when not strictly necessary, and slower to
// recover after pinning forces limit to be substantially exceeded. (Even with
// strict_capacity_limit=true, RocksDB will nevertheless transiently allocate
// memory before discovering it is over the block cache capacity, so this
// should not be a detectable regression in respecting memory limits, except
// on exceptionally small caches.)
// * In some cases, erased or duplicated entries might not be freed
// immediately. They will eventually be freed by eviction from further Inserts.
// * Internal metadata can overflow if the number of simultaneous references
// to a cache handle reaches many millions.
//
// High-level eviction algorithm
// -----------------------------
// A score (or "countdown") is maintained for each entry, initially determined
// by priority. The score is incremented on each Lookup, up to a max of 3,
// though is easily returned to previous state if useful=false with Release.
// During CLOCK-style eviction iteration, entries with score > 0 are
// decremented if currently unreferenced and entries with score == 0 are
// evicted if currently unreferenced. Note that scoring might not be perfect
// because entries can be referenced transiently within the cache even when
// there are no outside references to the entry.
//
// Cache sharding like LRUCache is used to reduce contention on usage+eviction
// state, though here the performance improvement from more shards is small,
// and (as noted above) potentially detrimental if shard capacity is too close
// to largest entry size. Here cache sharding mostly only affects cache update
// (Insert / Erase) performance, not read performance.
//
// Read efficiency (hot path)
// --------------------------
// Mostly to minimize the cost of accessing metadata blocks with
// cache_index_and_filter_blocks=true, we focus on optimizing Lookup and
// Release. In terms of concurrency, at a minimum, these operations have
// to do reference counting (and Lookup has to compare full keys in a safe
// way). Can we fold in all the other metadata tracking *for free* with
// Lookup and Release doing a simple atomic fetch_add/fetch_sub? (Assume
// for the moment that Lookup succeeds on the first probe.)
//
// We have a clever way of encoding an entry's reference count and countdown
// clock so that Lookup and Release are each usually a single atomic addition.
// In a single metadata word we have both an "acquire" count, incremented by
// Lookup, and a "release" count, incremented by Release. If useful=false,
// Release can instead decrement the acquire count. Thus the current ref
// count is (acquires - releases), and the countdown clock is min(3, acquires).
// Note that only unreferenced entries (acquires == releases) are eligible
// for CLOCK manipulation and eviction. We tolerate use of more expensive
// compare_exchange operations for cache writes (insertions and erasures).
//
// In a cache receiving many reads and little or no writes, it is possible
// for the acquire and release counters to overflow. Assuming the *current*
// refcount never reaches to many millions, we only have to correct for
// overflow in both counters in Release, not in Lookup. The overflow check
// should be only 1-2 CPU cycles per Release because it is a predictable
// branch on a simple condition on data already in registers.
//
// Slot states
// -----------
// We encode a state indicator into the same metadata word with the
// acquire and release counters. This allows bigger state transitions to
// be atomic. States:
//
// * Empty - slot is not in use and unowned. All other metadata and data is
// in an undefined state.
// * Construction - slot is exclusively owned by one thread, the thread
// successfully entering this state, for populating or freeing data
// (de-construction, same state marker).
// * Shareable (group) - slot holds an entry with counted references for
// pinning and reading, including
//   * Visible - slot holds an entry that can be returned by Lookup
//   * Invisible - slot holds an entry that is not visible to Lookup
//     (erased by user) but can be read by existing references, and ref count
//     changed by Ref and Release.
//
// A special case is "standalone" entries, which are heap-allocated handles
// not in the table. They are always Invisible and freed on zero refs.
//
// State transitions:
// Empty -> Construction (in Insert): The encoding of state enables Insert to
// perform an optimistic atomic bitwise-or to take ownership if a slot is
// empty, or otherwise make no state change.
//
// Construction -> Visible (in Insert): This can be a simple assignment to the
// metadata word because the current thread has exclusive ownership and other
// metadata is meaningless.
//
// Visible -> Invisible (in Erase): This can be a bitwise-and while holding
// a shared reference, which is safe because the change is idempotent (in case
// of parallel Erase). By the way, we never go Invisible->Visible.
//
// Shareable -> Construction (in Evict part of Insert, in Erase, and in
// Release if Invisible): This is for starting to freeing/deleting an
// unreferenced entry. We have to use compare_exchange to ensure we only make
// this transition when there are zero refs.
//
// Construction -> Empty (in same places): This is for completing free/delete
// of an entry. A "release" atomic store suffices, as we have exclusive
// ownership of the slot but have to ensure none of the data member reads are
// re-ordered after committing the state transition.
//
// Insert
// ------
// If Insert were to guarantee replacing an existing entry for a key, there
// would be complications for concurrency and efficiency. First, consider how
// many probes to get to an entry. To ensure Lookup never waits and
// availability of a key is uninterrupted, we would need to use a different
// slot for a new entry for the same key. This means it is most likely in a
// later probing position than the old version, which should soon be removed.
// (Also, an entry is too big to replace atomically, even if no current refs.)
//
// However, overwrite capability is not really needed by RocksDB. Also, we
// know from our "redundant" stats that overwrites are very rare for the block
// cache, so we should not spend much to make them effective.
//
// FixedHyperClockCache: Instead we Insert as soon as we find an empty slot in
// the probing sequence without seeing an existing (visible) entry for the same
// key. This way we only insert if we can improve the probing performance, and
// we don't need to probe beyond our insert position, assuming we are willing
// to let the previous entry for the same key die of old age (eventual eviction
// from not being used). We can reach a similar state with concurrent
// insertions, where one will pass over the other while it is "under
// construction." This temporary duplication is acceptable for RocksDB block
// cache because we know redundant insertion is rare.
// AutoHyperClockCache: Similar, except we only notice and return an existing
// match if it is found in the search for a suitable empty slot (starting with
// the same slot as the head pointer), not by following the existing chain of
// entries. Insertions are always made to the head of the chain.
//
// Another problem to solve is what to return to the caller when we find an
// existing entry whose probing position we cannot improve on, or when the
// table occupancy limit has been reached. If strict_capacity_limit=false,
// we must never fail Insert, and if a Handle* is provided, we have to return
// a usable Cache handle on success. The solution to this (typically rare)
// problem is "standalone" handles, which are usable by the caller but not
// actually available for Lookup in the Cache. Standalone handles are allocated
// independently on the heap and specially marked so that they are freed on
// the heap when their last reference is released.
//
// Usage on capacity
// -----------------
// Insert takes different approaches to usage tracking depending on
// strict_capacity_limit setting. If true, we enforce a kind of strong
// consistency where compare-exchange is used to ensure the usage number never
// exceeds its limit, and provide threads with an authoritative signal on how
// much "usage" they have taken ownership of. With strict_capacity_limit=false,
// we use a kind of "eventual consistency" where all threads Inserting to the
// same cache shard might race on reserving the same space, but the
// over-commitment will be worked out in later insertions. It is kind of a
// dance because we don't want threads racing each other too much on paying
// down the over-commitment (with eviction) either.
//
// Eviction
// --------
// A key part of Insert is evicting some entries currently unreferenced to
// make room for new entries. The high-level eviction algorithm is described
// above, but the details are also interesting. A key part is parallelizing
// eviction with a single CLOCK pointer. This works by each thread working on
// eviction pre-emptively incrementing the CLOCK pointer, and then CLOCK-
// updating or evicting the incremented-over slot(s). To reduce contention at
// the cost of possibly evicting too much, each thread increments the clock
// pointer by 4, so commits to updating at least 4 slots per batch. As
// described above, a CLOCK update will decrement the "countdown" of
// unreferenced entries, or evict unreferenced entries with zero countdown.
// Referenced entries are not updated, because we (presumably) don't want
// long-referenced entries to age while referenced. Note however that we
// cannot distinguish transiently referenced entries from cache user
// references, so some CLOCK updates might be somewhat arbitrarily skipped.
// This is OK as long as it is rare enough that eviction order is still
// pretty good.
//
// There is no synchronization on the completion of the CLOCK updates, so it
// is theoretically possible for another thread to cycle back around and have
// two threads racing on CLOCK updates to the same slot. Thus, we cannot rely
// on any implied exclusivity to make the updates or eviction more efficient.
// These updates use an opportunistic compare-exchange (no loop), where a
// racing thread might cause the update to be skipped without retry, but in
// such case the update is likely not needed because the most likely update
// to an entry is that it has become referenced. (TODO: test efficiency of
// avoiding compare-exchange loop)
//
// Release
// -------
// In the common case, Release is a simple atomic increment of the release
// counter. There is a simple overflow check that only does another atomic
// update in extremely rare cases, so costs almost nothing.
//
// If the Release specifies "not useful", we can instead decrement the
// acquire counter, which returns to the same CLOCK state as before Lookup
// or Ref.
//
// Adding a check for over-full cache on every release to zero-refs would
// likely be somewhat expensive, increasing read contention on cache shard
// metadata. Instead we are less aggressive about deleting entries right
// away in those cases.
//
// However Release tries to immediately delete entries reaching zero refs
// if (a) erase_if_last_ref is set by the caller, or (b) the entry is already
// marked invisible. Both of these are checks on values already in CPU
// registers so do not increase cross-CPU contention when not applicable.
// When applicable, they use a compare-exchange loop to take exclusive
// ownership of the slot for freeing the entry. These are rare cases
// that should not usually affect performance.
//
// Erase
// -----
// Searches for an entry like Lookup but moves it to Invisible state if found.
// This state transition is with bit operations so is idempotent and safely
// done while only holding a shared "read" reference. Like Release, it makes
// a best effort to immediately release an Invisible entry that reaches zero
// refs, but there are some corner cases where it will only be freed by the
// clock eviction process.

// Hash table for cache entries that resizes automatically based on occupancy.
// However, it depends on a contiguous memory region to grow into
// incrementally, using linear hashing, so uses an anonymous mmap so that
// only the used portion of the memory region is mapped to physical memory
// (part of RSS).
//
// This table implementation uses the same "low-level protocol" for managing
// the contens of an entry slot as FixedHyperClockTable does, captured in the
// ClockHandle struct. The provides most of the essential data safety, but
// AutoHyperClockTable is another "high-level protocol" for organizing entries
// into a hash table, with automatic resizing.
//
// This implementation is not fully wait-free but we can call it "essentially
// wait-free," and here's why. First, like FixedHyperClockCache, there is no
// locking nor other forms of waiting at the cache or shard level. Also like
// FixedHCC there is essentially an entry-level read-write lock implemented
// with atomics, but our relaxed atomicity/consistency guarantees (e.g.
// duplicate inserts are possible) mean we do not need to wait for entry
// locking. Lookups, non-erasing Releases, and non-evicting non-growing Inserts
// are all fully wait-free. Of course, these waits are not dependent on any
// external factors such as I/O.
//
// For operations that remove entries from a chain or grow the table by
// splitting a chain, there is a chain-level locking mechanism that we call a
// "rewrite" lock, and the only waits are for these locks. On average, each
// chain lock is relevant to < 2 entries each. (The average would be less than
// one entry each, but we do not lock when there's no entry to remove or
// migrate.) And a given thread can only hold two such chain locks at a time,
// more typically just one. So in that sense alone, the waiting that does exist
// is very localized.
//
// If we look closer at the operations utilizing that locking mechanism, we
// can see why it's "essentially wait-free."
// * Grow operations to increase the size of the table: each operation splits
// an existing chain into two, and chains for splitting are chosen in table
// order. Grow operations are fully parallel except for the chain locking, but
// for one Grow operation to wait on another, it has to be feeding into the
// other, which means the table has doubled in size already from other Grow
// operations without the original one finishing. So Grow operations are very
// low latency (unlike LRUCache doubling the table size in one operation) and
// very parallelizeable. (We use some tricks to break up dependencies in
// updating metadata on the usable size of the table.) And obviously Grow
// operations are very rare after the initial population of the table.
// * Evict operations (part of many Inserts): clock updates and evictions
// sweep through the structure in table order, so like Grow operations,
// parallel Evict can only wait on each other if an Evict has lingered (slept)
// long enough that the clock pointer has wrapped around the entire structure.
// * Random erasures (Erase, Release with erase_if_last_ref, etc.): these
// operations are rare and not really considered performance critical.
// Currently they're mostly used for removing placeholder cache entries, e.g.
// for memory tracking, though that could use standalone entries instead to
// avoid potential contention in table operations. It's possible that future
// enhancements could pro-actively remove cache entries from obsolete files,
// but that's not yet implemented.

    // To orgainize AutoHyperClockTable entries into a hash table while
    // allowing the table size to grow without existing entries being moved,
    // a version of chaining is used. Rather than being heap allocated (and
    // incurring overheads to ensure memory safety) entries must go into
    // Handles ("slots") in the pre-allocated array. To improve CPU cache
    // locality, the chain head pointers are interleved with the entries;
    // specifically, a Handle contains
    // * A head pointer for a chain of entries with this "home" location.
    // * A ClockHandle, for an entry that may or may not be in the chain
    // starting from that head (but for performance ideally is on that
    // chain).
    // * A next pointer for the continuation of the chain containing this
    // entry.
    //
    // The pointers are not raw pointers, but are indices into the array,
    // and are decorated in two ways to help detect and recover from
    // relevant concurrent modifications during Lookup, so that Lookup is
    // fully wait-free:
    // * Each "with_shift" pointer contains a shift count that indicates
    // how many hash bits were used in chosing the home address for the
    // chain--specifically the next entry in the chain.
    // * The end of a chain is given a special "end" marker and refers back
    // to the head of the chain.
    //
    // Why do we need shift on each pointer? To make Lookup wait-free, we need
    // to be able to query a chain without missing anything, and preferably
    // avoid synchronously double-checking the length_info. Without the shifts,
    // there is a risk that we start down a chain and while paused on an entry
    // that goes to a new home, we then follow the rest of the
    // partially-migrated chain to see the shared ending with the old home, but
