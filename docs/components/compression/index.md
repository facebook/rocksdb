# RocksDB Compression

## Overview

RocksDB supports multiple compression algorithms to reduce storage footprint and I/O bandwidth. Compression operates at the block level for SST files, with optional support for WAL and blob files. Users can configure different compression algorithms per LSM level, enabling tradeoffs between CPU cost and storage savings across the data lifecycle.

**Key source files:** `include/rocksdb/compression_type.h`, `util/compression.h`, `util/compression.cc`, `table/block_based/block_based_table_builder.cc`, `table/block_based/block_based_table_reader.cc`

## Key Characteristics

- **Multiple algorithms**: Snappy, Zlib, LZ4, LZ4HC, ZSTD, BZip2, Xpress (Windows), kNoCompression; extensible via managed compression for custom algorithms
- **Per-level compression**: Different algorithms for L0-Ln and bottommost level
- **Dictionary compression**: Dictionary training for improved ratios on repetitive data (ZSTD dictionary training; Zlib/LZ4/LZ4HC also support dictionary use)
- **Block-level granularity**: Data blocks always compressed; filter blocks always uncompressed; index blocks compressed only if `enable_index_compression=true` (default)
- **Context reuse**: Compression/decompression contexts cached per-core for ZSTD
- **Compressed secondary cache**: Optional caching of compressed blocks
- **Parallel compression**: Multi-threaded compression during flush/compaction (not recommended for lightweight codecs like Snappy/LZ4)
- **Adaptive compression**: Skip compression if ratio below threshold (`max_compressed_bytes_per_kb`)

## Key Invariants

- Compression type stored in every block trailer (persistent format)
- Checksum on compressed data, verified before decompression
- Dictionary shared across all blocks in an SST file
- ZSTD contexts cached per CPU core, not per SST file
