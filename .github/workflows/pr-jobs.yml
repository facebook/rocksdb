  # NOTE: multiple workflows would be recommended, but the current GHA UI in
  # PRs doesn't make it clear when there's an overall error with a workflow,
  # making it easy to overlook something broken. Grouping everything into one
  # workflow minimizes the problem because it will be suspicious if there are
  # no GHA results.
  #
  # The if: ${{ github.repository_owner == 'facebook' }} lines prevent the
  # jobs from attempting to run on repo forks, because of a few problems:
  # * runs-on labels are repository (owner) specific, so the job might wait
  # for days waiting for a runner that simply isn't available.
  # * Pushes to branches on forks for pull requests (the normal process) would
  # run the workflow jobs twice: once in the pull-from fork and once for the PR
  # destination repo. This is wasteful and dumb.
  # * It is not known how to avoid copy-pasting the line to each job,
  # increasing the risk of misconfiguration, especially on forks that might
  # want to run with this GHA setup.
  #
  # DEBUGGING WITH SSH: Temporarily add this as a job step, either before the
  # step of interest without the "if:" line or after the failing step with the
  # "if:" line. Then use ssh command printed in CI output.
