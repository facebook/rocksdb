  // target size to be 1/max_bytes_for_level_multiplier of the last level's
  // extra size. After the data accumulates more so that we need to move the
  // base level to the third last one, and so on.

  // For example, assume max_bytes_for_level_multiplier=10, num_levels=6,
  // and max_bytes_for_level_base=10MB.
  // Target sizes of level 1 to 5 starts with:
  // [- - - - 10MB]
  // with base level is level 5. Target sizes of level 1 to 4 are not applicable

  // Until the size of Level 5 grows to more than 10MB, say 11MB, we make
  // base target to level 4 and now the targets looks like:
  // [- - - 1.1MB 11MB]
  // While data are accumulated, size targets are tuned based on actual data
  // of level 5. When level 5 has 50MB of data, the target is like:
  // [- - - 5MB 50MB]
  // Until level 5's actual size is more than 100MB, say 101MB. Now if we keep
  // level 4 to be the base level, its target size needs to be 10.1MB, which
  // doesn't satisfy the target size range. So now we make level 3 the target
  // size and the target sizes of the levels look like:
  // [- - 1.01MB 10.1MB 101MB]
  // In the same way, while level 5 further grows, all levels' targets grow,
  // like
  // [- - 5MB 50MB 500MB]
  // Until level 5 exceeds 1000MB and becomes 1001MB, we make level 2 the
  // base level and make levels' target sizes like this:
  // [- 1.001MB 10.01MB 100.1MB 1001MB]
  // and go on...
  //
  // By doing it, we give max_bytes_for_level_multiplier a priority against
  // max_bytes_for_level_base, for a more predictable LSM tree shape. It is
  // useful to limit worse case space amplification.
  // If `allow_ingest_behind=true` or `preclude_last_level_data_seconds > 0`,
  // then the last level is reserved, and we will start filling LSM from the
  // second last level.
  //
  // With this option on, compaction is more adaptive to write traffic:
  // Compaction priority will take into account estimated bytes to be compacted
  // down to a level and favors compacting lower levels when there is a write
  // traffic spike (and hence more compaction debt). Refer to
  // https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Leveled-Compactio#option-level_compaction_dynamic_level_bytes-and-levels-target-size
  // for more detailed description. See more implementation detail in:
  // VersionStorageInfo::ComputeCompactionScore().
  //
  // With this option on, unneeded levels will be drained automatically:
  // Note that there may be excessive levels (where target level size is 0 when
  // computed based on this feature) in the LSM. This can happen after a user
  // migrates to turn this feature on or deletes a lot of data. This is

  // drain these unnecessary levels by compacting files down the LSM. Smaller
