  // Until the size of Level 5 grows to more than 10MB, say 11MB, we make
  // base target to level 4 and now the targets looks like:
  // [- - - 1.1MB 11MB]
  // While data are accumulated, size targets are tuned based on actual data
  // of level 5. When level 5 has 50MB of data, the target is like:
  // [- - - 5MB 50MB]
  // Until level 5's actual size is more than 100MB, say 101MB. Now if we keep
  // level 4 to be the base level, its target size needs to be 10.1MB, which
  // doesn't satisfy the target size range. So now we make level 3 the target
  // size and the target sizes of the levels look like:
  // [- - 1.01MB 10.1MB 101MB]
  // In the same way, while level 5 further grows, all levels' targets grow,
  // like
  // [- - 5MB 50MB 500MB]
  // Until level 5 exceeds 1000MB and becomes 1001MB, we make level 2 the
  // base level and make levels' target sizes like this:
  // [- 1.001MB 10.01MB 100.1MB 1001MB]
