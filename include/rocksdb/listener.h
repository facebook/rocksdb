//
// IMPORTANT
// Because compaction is needed to resolve a "writes stopped" condition,
// calling or waiting for any blocking DB write function (no_slowdown=false)
// from a compaction-related listener callback can hang RocksDB. For DB
// writes from a callback we recommend a WriteBatch and no_slowdown=true,
// because the WriteBatch can accumulate writes for later in case DB::Write
// returns Status::Incomplete. Similarly, calling CompactRange or similar
// could hang by waiting for a background worker that is occupied until the
// callback returns.
//
// Otherwise, callback functions should not run for an extended period of
// time before the function returns, because this will slow RocksDB.
//
// [Threading] All EventListener callback will be called using the
// actual thread that involves in that specific event.   For example, it
// is the RocksDB background flush thread that does the actual flush to
// call EventListener::OnFlushCompleted().
//
// [Locking] All EventListener callbacks are designed to be called without
// the current thread holding any DB mutex. This is to prevent potential
// deadlock and performance issue when using EventListener callback
// in a complex way.
//
// [Exceptions] Exceptions MUST NOT propagate out of overridden functions into
// RocksDB, because RocksDB is not exception-safe. This could cause undefined
// behavior including data loss, unreported corruption, deadlocks, and more.
