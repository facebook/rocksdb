// recommended to avoid TOCTOU bugs. Specifically, particular kinds of
// concurrent operations behave like this:

// op1\op2| Read  | Append | Write
// -------|-------|--------|--------
//   Read | conc  | block  | block
// Append | block | block  | block
//  Write | block | block  | block
//
// conc = operations safely proceed concurrently
// block = one of the operations safely blocks until the other completes.
//   There is generally no guarantee as to which completes first.
//
// StopBackup is the only operation that affects an ongoing operation.
//
// # Interleaving operations between BackupEngine* objects open on the
// same backup_dir
//
// It is recommended only to have one BackupEngine* object open for a given
// backup_dir, but it is possible to mix / interleave some operations
// (regardless of whether they are concurrent) with these caveats:
//
// op1\op2|  Open  |  Read  | Append | Write
// -------|--------|--------|--------|--------
//   Open | conc   | conc   | atomic | unspec
//   Read | conc   | conc   | old    | unspec
// Append | atomic | old    | unspec | unspec
//  Write | unspec | unspec | unspec | unspec
//
// Special case: Open with destroy_old_data=true is really a Write
//
// conc = operations safely proceed, concurrently when applicable
// atomic = operations are effectively atomic; if a concurrent Append
//   operation has not completed at some key point during Open, the
//   opened BackupEngine* will never see the result of the Append op.
// old = Read operations do not include any state changes from other
//   BackupEngine* objects; they return the state at their Open time.
