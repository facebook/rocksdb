# Contributing to RocksDB-Cloud

## Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")

In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You
only need to do this once, so if you've done this for another Rockset
open source project, you're good to go. If you are submitting a pull
request for the first time, just let us know that you have completed
the CLA and we can cross-check with your GitHub username. The CLA
is precisely the same CLA as used by github.com/facebook/rocksdb.

Please download the CLA from https://goo.gl/qZpjvu, print it on
paper, sign it and scan it into a pdf file. Then create a new issue at
https://github.com/rockset/rocksdb-cloud/issues/new and attach your
scanned pdf file to that issue.

## License

By contributing to RocksDB-Cloud, you agree that your contributions will be
licensed under the [BSD License](LICENSE).
