//
// This "zero is invalid unless you are the embedded reader/writer" contract is
// enforced by integrity checks that reject file number zero on generic paths;
// see FileMetaData::UpdateBoundaries (write/output path) and Version::GetBlob /
// Version::MultiGetBlob (read path). Same-file references must be resolved (by
// EmbeddedBlobResolvingIterator) before they reach those paths. Do not weaken

// [range_offset, range_offset + range_length).
//
// This is the internal counterpart of the public kLazyWholeColumn
// (include/rocksdb/lazy_wide_columns.h); both are the maximum size_t. The lazy
// resolver does not forward the public value as a range descriptor -- it
// normalizes a whole-column request to kWholeBlobLength -- so the two are not
// required to be equal, but both rely on the sentinel exceeding any real
// blob/column size so a "whole" request is never mistaken for a strict
// sub-range. Keep them in sync.

//  - kVerifyIfPresent: verify the whole-record checksum whenever the format
//    provides one, even if ReadOptions::verify_checksums is off. A byte-range
//    request under this policy is escalated to a whole-record read (a strict
//    sub-range cannot cover the checksum). This is the public force_verify.
//  - kVerifyIfNoAmplification: verify when the checksummable unit is already
//    being read -- a whole-value read verifies (the check is "free"), while a
//    strict sub-range read skips verification rather than amplify the read to
//    the whole record. Corresponds to verify_checksums on, force_verify off.
//  - kSkip: never verify. Corresponds to verify_checksums off, force_verify
//    off.
