* To reduce risk of ODR violations or similar, `ROCKSDB_USING_THREAD_STATUS` has been removed from public headers and replaced with static `const bool ThreadStatus::kEnabled`. Some other uses of conditional compilation have been removed from public API headers to reduce risk of ODR violations or other issues.
