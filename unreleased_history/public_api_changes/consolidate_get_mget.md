Declare one Get and one MultiGet variant as pure virtual, and make all the other variants non-overridable. The methods required to be implemented by derived classes of DB allow returning timestamps. It is up to the implementation to check and return an error if timestamps are not supported. The non-batched MultiGet APIs are reimplemented in terms of batched MultiGet, so callers might see a performance improvement.
