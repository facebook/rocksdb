Added new option target_file_size_is_upper_bound  that makes most compaction output SST files come close to the target file size without exceeding it, rather than commonly exceeding it by some fraction (current behavior).  The behavior is enabled by default and can be disabled by setting false target_file_size_is_upper_bound.
