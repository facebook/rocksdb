Add a new option `CompactionOptionsUniversal::reduce_file_locking` and if it's true, auto universal compaction picking will adjust to minimize locking of input files when bottom priority compactions are waiting to run. This can increase the likelihood of existing L0s being selected for compaction, thereby improving write stall and reducing read regression.
