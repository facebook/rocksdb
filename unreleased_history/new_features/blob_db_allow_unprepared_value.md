When using iterators with BlobDB, it is now possible to load large values on an on-demand basis, i.e. only if they are actually needed by the application. This can save I/O in use cases where the values associated with certain keys are not needed. For more details, see the new read option `allow_unprepared_value` and the iterator API `PrepareValue`.
