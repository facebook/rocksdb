Adds a new option for transient CFs, for which data/metadata should not be persisted in the db long term. Transient CFs are not included in the manifest, and transient cf data is not included in backups/checkpoints. As a result, transient cf metadata only exists in memory, and if the db crashes or is restarted, transient CF sst files will be orphaned, and will be cleaned up eventually. Version edits will be created for transient CFs, but these version edits will not be written to the manifest. The only metadata concerning transient CFs will be lost when the db restarts. Users will be able to create transient CFs and roll back to older versions of RocksDB without issue. Attempting to reopen a db with transient cfs that were previously created will fail, unless creater_missing_column_families=true, in which case, a new transient cf will be created.
