Adds a new option for transient CFs, for which data/metadata should not be persisted in the db long term. Transient cfs are dropped upon db restart, and they are excluded from backup/checkpoint. There will be references to transient cfs in WAL & Manifest. Attempting to open a db instance with transient cfs passed in will fail, as will attempting to open CFs with the wrong options (opening a transient CF as non-transient or vice versa). If a rocksdb instance is created with a transient CF, it can be reopened by older versions of RocksDB, as long as ignore_unknown_options is set to true during db open. This will ignore the is_transient field in the options file, and allow the user to reopen all transient CFs as regular CFs (they will not be dropped).
