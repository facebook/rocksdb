Experimental feature: RocksDB now supports FAISS inverted file based indices via the secondary indexing framework. Applications can use FAISS secondary indices to automatically quantize embeddings and perform K-nearest-neighbors similarity searches. See `FaissIVFIndex` and `SecondaryIndex` for more details. Note: the FAISS integration currently requires using the BUCK build.
