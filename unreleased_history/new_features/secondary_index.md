Experimental feature: RocksDB now supports defining secondary indices, which are automatically maintained by the storage engine. Secondary indices provide a new customization point: applications can provide their own by implementing the new `SecondaryIndex` interface. See the `SecondaryIndex` API comments for more details. Note: this feature is currently only available in conjunction with write-committed pessimistic transactions, and `Merge` is not yet supported.
