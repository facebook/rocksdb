* Added an auto-tuning feature for DB manifest file size that also (by default) improves the safety of existing configurations in case `max_manifest_file_size` is repeatedly exceeded. The new recommendation is to set `max_manifest_file_size` to something small like 1MB and tune `max_manifest_space_amp_pct` as needed to balance write amp and space amp in the manifest. Refer to comments on those options in `DBOptions` for details. Both options are (now) mutable.
