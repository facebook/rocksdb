Added tail size estimation during SST construction to prevent compaction files from exceeding their target size. Previously, compaction logic only considered data size when determining where to cut files, failing to reserve space for the tail (index, filter and other meta blocks) appended to the file. With this new feature enabled by default, compaction files are now more accurately sized, reducing the likelihood of exceeding target sizes. This feature only supports some index and filter types. Refer to `compaction_use_tail_size_estimation` in DBOptions for more details.
