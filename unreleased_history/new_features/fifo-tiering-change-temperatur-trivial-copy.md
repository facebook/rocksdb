* Add new experimental `CompactionOptionsFIFO::allow_trivial_copy_when_change_temperature` along with `CompactionOptionsFIFO::trivial_copy_buffer_size` to allow optimizing FIFO compactions with tiering when kChangeTemperature to move files from source tier FileSystem to another tier FileSystem via trivial and direct copying raw sst file instead of reading thru the content of the SST file then rebuilding the table files.
