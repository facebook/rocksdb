The following pointer configurations to pass to remote worker are no longer explicitly set by CompactionServiceOptionsOverride - comparator, merge_operator, compaction_filter, compaction_filter_factory, prefix_extractor, table_factory, and sst_partitioner_factory. They need to be registered in the ObjectRegistry of the remote worker prior to the compaction. Please note that Remote Compaction APIs are still marked as experimental and subject to change.
