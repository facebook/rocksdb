Changed the semantics of the BlobDB configuration option `blob_garbage_collection_force_threshold` to define a threshold for the overall garbage ratio of all blob files currently eligible for garbage collection (according to `blob_garbage_collection_age_cutoff`). This can provide better control over space amplification at the cost of slightly higher write amplification.
