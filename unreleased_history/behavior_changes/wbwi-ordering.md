* Reversed the order of updates to the same key in WriteBatchWithIndex. This means if there are multiple updates to the same key, the most recent update is ordered first. This affects the output of WBWIIterator. When WriteBatchWithIndex is created with `overwrite_key=true`, this affects the output only if Merge is used (#13387).
