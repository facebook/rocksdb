* The default provided block cache implementation is now HyperClockCache instead of LRUCache, when `block_cache` is nullptr (default) and `no_block_cache==false` (default). We recommend explicitly creating a HyperClockCache block cache based on memory budget and sharing it across all column families and even DB instances. This change could expose previously hidden memory or resource leaks.
