PointLockManager was not efficient when there is high write contention on same key, as it uses a single conditional variable per lock stripe. A new PerKeyPointLockManager is added, which uses per thread conditional variable supporting fifo order. The throughput of High contention exclusive lock on same key was improved by up to 70% measured by point_lock_bench. Although this is an experimental feature, by default, it is disabled.
