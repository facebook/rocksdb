* Majorly improved CPU efficiency and scalability of parallel compression (`CompressionOptions::parallel_threads` > 1), though this efficiency improvement makes parallel compression currently incompatible with UserDefinedIndex and with old setting of `decouple_partitioned_filters=false`. Parallel compression is now considered a production-ready feature. Maximum performance is available with `-DROCKSDB_USE_STD_SEMAPHORES` at compile time, but this is not currently recommended because of reported bugs in implementations of `std::counting_semaphore`/`binary_semaphore`.
