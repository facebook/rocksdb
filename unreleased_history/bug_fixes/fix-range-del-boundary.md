* Fix a bug where compaction with range deletion can persist kTypeMaxValid in MANIFEST as file metadata. kTypeMaxValid is not supposed to be persisted and can change as new value types are introduced. This can cause a forward compatibility issue where older versions of RocksDB don't recognize kTypeMaxValid from newer versions. A new placeholder value type kTypeTruncatedRangeDeletionSentinel is also introduced to replace kTypeMaxValid when reading existing SST files' metadata from MANIFEST. This allows us to strengthen some checks to avoid using kTypeMaxValid in the future.
