* Fix a bug in `GetMergeOperands()` that can return incorrect status (MergeInProgress) and incorrect number of merge operands. This can happen when `GetMergeOperandsOptions::continue_cb` is set, both active and immutable memtables have merge operands and the callback stops the look up at the immutable memtable.
