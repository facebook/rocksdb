Fixed an infinite compaction loop bug with User-Defined Timestamps (UDT) where bottommost files were repeatedly marked for compaction even though their timestamp could not be collapsed. This occurred because the marking logic only checked if `largest_seqno < oldest_snapshot_seqnum` but did not verify that the file's maximum timestamp was below `full_history_ts_low`. Added `min_timestamp` and `max_timestamp` fields to `FileMetaData` to track timestamp ranges per SST file, enabling proper filtering of files for bottommost compaction. For backward compatibility with older SST files that don't have timestamp metadata in the manifest, the implementation falls back to reading from the SST table properties block. Forward compatibility is not a concern because the new manifest tags (`kMinTimestamp`, `kMaxTimestamp`) are below `kCustomTagNonSafeIgnoreMask`, meaning older RocksDB versions will safely skip these unknown fields when reading the manifest.
