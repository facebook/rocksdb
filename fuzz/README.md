# Fuzzing RocksDB

## Overview

This directory contains [fuzz tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing) for RocksDB.
RocksDB testing infrastructure currently includes unit tests and [stress tests](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Stress-test),
we hope fuzz testing can catch more bugs.

## Prerequisite

We use [LLVM libFuzzer](http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) as the fuzzying engine,
so make sure you have [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html) as your compiler.

Some tests rely on [structure aware fuzzing](https://github.com/google/fuzzing/blob/master/docs/structure-aware-fuzzing.md).
We use [protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) to define structured input to the fuzzer,
and use [libprotobuf-mutator](https://github.com/google/libprotobuf-mutator) as the custom libFuzzer mutator.
So make sure you have protobuf and libprotobuf-mutator installed, and make sure `pkg-config` can find them.
On some systems, there are both protobuf2 and protobuf3 in the package management system,
make sure protobuf3 is installed.

If you do not want to install protobuf library yourself, you can rely on libprotobuf-mutator to download protobuf
for you. For details about installation, please refer to [libprotobuf-mutator README](https://github.com/google/libprotobuf-mutator#readme)

## Example

This example shows you how to do structure aware fuzzing to `rocksdb::SstFileWriter`.

After walking through the steps to create the fuzzer, we'll introduce a bug into `rocksdb::SstFileWriter::Put`,
then show that the fuzzer can catch the bug.

### Design the test

We want the fuzzing engine to automatically generate a list of database operations,
then we apply these operations to `SstFileWriter` in sequence,
finally, after the SST file is generated, we use `SstFileReader` to check the file's checksum.

### Define input

We define the database operations in protobuf, each operation has a type of operation and a key value pair,
see [proto/db_operation.proto](proto/db_operation.proto) for details.

### Define tests with the input

In [sst_file_writer_fuzzer.cc](sst_file_writer_fuzzer.cc),
we define the tests to be run on the generated input:

```
DEFINE_PROTO_FUZZER(DBOperations& input) {
  // apply the operations to SstFileWriter and use SstFileReader to verify checksum.
  // ...
}
```

`SstFileWriter` requires the keys of the operations to be unique and be in ascending order,
but the fuzzing engine generates the input randomly, so we need to process the generated input before
passing it to `DEFINE_PROTO_FUZZER`, this is accomplished by registering a post processor:

```
protobuf_mutator::libfuzzer::PostProcessorRegistration<DBOperations>
```

### Compile and link the fuzzer

In the rocksdb root directory, compile rocksdb library by `make static_lib`.

Go to the `fuzz` directory,
run `make sst_file_writer_fuzzer` to generate the fuzzer,
it will compile rocksdb static library, generate protobuf, then compile and link `sst_file_writer_fuzzer`.

### Introduce a bug

Manually introduce a bug to `SstFileWriter::Put`:

```
diff --git a/table/sst_file_writer.cc b/table/sst_file_writer.cc
index ab1ee7c4e..c7da9ffa0 100644
--- a/table/sst_file_writer.cc
+++ b/table/sst_file_writer.cc
@@ -277,6 +277,11 @@ Status SstFileWriter::Add(const Slice& user_key, const Slice& value) {
 }

 Status SstFileWriter::Put(const Slice& user_key, const Slice& value) {
+  if (user_key.starts_with("!")) {
+    if (value.ends_with("!")) {
+      return Status::Corruption("bomb");
+    }
+  }
   return rep_->Add(user_key, value, ValueType::kTypeValue);
 }
```

The bug is that for `Put`, if `user_key` starts with `!` and `value` ends with `!`, then corrupt.

### Run fuzz testing to catch the bug

Run the fuzzer by `time ./sst_file_writer_fuzzer`.

Here is the output on my machine:

The above crash can be reproduced by `./sst_file_writer_fuzzer ./crash-a1460be302d09b548e61787178d9edaa40aea467`,
so you can debug the crash.

## Future Work

According to [OSS-Fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz),
`as of June 2020, OSS-Fuzz has found over 20,000 bugs in 300 open source projects.`

RocksDB can join OSS-Fuzz together with other open source projects such as sqlite.
