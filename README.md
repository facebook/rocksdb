# RocksDB: A Persistent Key-Value Store for Flash and RAM Storage

[![CircleCI Status](https://circleci.com/gh/facebook/rocksdb.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/facebook/rocksdb)

RocksDB is developed and maintained by Facebook Database Engineering Team.
It is built on earlier work on [LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb) by Sanjay Ghemawat (sanjay@google.com)
and Jeff Dean (jeff@google.com)

This code is a library that forms the core building block for a fast
key-value server, especially suited for storing data on flash drives.
It has a Log-Structured-Merge-Database (LSM) design with flexible tradeoffs
between Write-Amplification-Factor (WAF), Read-Amplification-Factor (RAF)
and Space-Amplification-Factor (SAF). It has multi-threaded compactions,
making it especially suitable for storing multiple terabytes of data in a
single database.

internal APIs may be changed without warning.
